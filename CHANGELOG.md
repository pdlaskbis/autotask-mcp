## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Migrated to ESLint 9/10 flat config** ([#141](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/141)). ESLint 9 dropped support for the legacy `.eslintrc.json` format, and `@typescript-eslint` v6 can't run under it — so the `eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` Dependabot bumps were three coupled breaking changes that could only land together. Replaced `.eslintrc.json` with `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config) using the unified `typescript-eslint` package (bundles parser + plugin in version-lockstep), bumped `eslint` 8 → 10 and typescript-eslint 6 → 8, and added `@eslint/js` + `globals`. The ruleset is unchanged (`no-explicit-any`/`no-unused-vars` as warnings, `no-console` off, same ignores); lint output is identical at 0 errors / 193 warnings. `lint` script simplified from `eslint src --ext .ts` to `eslint src` (flat config infers extensions).
  - ESLint 10's `preserve-caught-error` rule surfaced three `catch` blocks that re-threw without preserving the original error. Fixed by attaching `{ cause: err }` to the rethrown `Error` in `autotask-http.ts` (network errors) and `config.ts` (zone-detection network + malformed-response errors), improving error chains for debugging. This required adding `ES2022.Error` to the tsconfig `lib` for the `Error(message, { cause })` constructor overload (emit target unchanged at ES2020; Node 18+ supports `Error.cause` at runtime).
  - Supersedes Dependabot PRs #113 (incorporated), #114 and #124 (parser/plugin replaced by the unified package). TypeScript 6 (#122) remains tracked separately in #141.

### Removed

- **Dropped Node.js 18 support.** ESLint 10 requires Node `^20.19 || ^22.13 || >=24`, and Node 18 reached end-of-life on 2025-04-30. Bumped `engines.node` to `>=20.0.0` and removed Node 18 from the CI test matrix and release pipeline (the Docker image already targets Node 22). Supported runtimes are now Node 20 and 22.

- **Published to GitHub Packages.** The npm package is now scoped to `@wyre-technology/autotask-mcp` (GitHub Packages rejects unscoped names) and `@semantic-release/npm` `npmPublish` is enabled. The release workflow now configures an authenticated `.npmrc` for `npm.pkg.github.com` and grants `packages: write`. The unscoped `bin` command name (`autotask-mcp`), the `io.github.wyre-technology/autotask-mcp` MCP Registry identifier, and the GHCR image name are unchanged.

### Added

- **A guard that tool descriptions may not name parameters the tool does not have** (`tests/tool-descriptions.test.ts`). Descriptions are the interface for an LLM-facing tool — they are what the model reads to decide what to pass — so naming a removed or nonexistent parameter sends the model looking for an affordance that isn't there. The check scans every tool's own description and all of its property descriptions for camelCase identifiers ending in `ID`/`Id` and requires each to match a declared parameter. All 98 tools pass.
  - The comparison is case-insensitive deliberately: `autotask_search_billing_items` declares `invoiceId` and its description says "invoiceID is set", referring to the Autotask entity field rather than the parameter. Matching case-insensitively admits that without an allowlist, which is better than an allowlist — allowlists accumulate entries and stop being read.
  - **What it does not catch, stated in the file itself:** it matches identifier-shaped references, not prose. The 2026-09-14 instance that prompted it read "when no ticket/task/project is specified" and contains no such token; that regression is pinned separately and by name in `tests/write-field-names.test.ts`. This guard covers a different slice of the same class, not that instance.
  - Includes a positive control that feeds the checker a synthetic tool whose description names an undeclared `projectID` and asserts it is flagged, plus a non-vacuity check on the scan itself — without them, "0 violations" would be indistinguishable from "0 checks". Verified by mutation: adding a `projectID` reference to a real description fails 1 test, and neutering the token regex fails 2.

- **`issueType` and `subIssueType` on `autotask_update_ticket`** ([#109](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/109)). Both fields are already accepted by the underlying payload builder (and have always been exposed on `autotask_create_ticket`), but the update tool's input schema didn't advertise them — so triage workflows couldn't change ticket issue classification on an existing ticket without falling back to `autotask_raw_request`. Added them as optional numeric picklist IDs with the same descriptions used on `autotask_create_ticket`. New tests in `tests/lazy-loading.test.ts` pin the schema shape and assert the handler forwards both fields to `updateTicket()`.

- **Structured rate-limit handling for Autotask API thresholds** ([#69](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/69), [#91](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/91)). Previously, when Autotask returned HTTP 429 (per-integration API threshold exceeded — ~10k req/hr soft, ~20k hard), the response bubbled up as a generic `Error` indistinguishable from a 500 or any other failure. LLM-driven workflows that fan out (e.g. "status report for all open projects with notes" — the canonical scenario @faspina reported) kept retrying the same expensive path while the user got threshold-exceeded emails from Autotask and saw disconnects.
  - New `AutotaskRateLimitError` (exported from `src/services/autotask-http.ts`) is thrown specifically on HTTP 429. Carries `retryAfterSeconds` parsed from the `Retry-After` response header (RFC 7231 — integer seconds or HTTP-date supported, falls back to 60s when missing/unparseable).
  - `AutotaskToolHandler.callTool` recognizes the typed error and returns a structured tool result with `error_type: "rate_limited"`, `retry_after_seconds`, and an explicit `instruction` field telling the LLM not to retry. Belt-and-suspenders for clients that don't parse `error_type` programmatically.
  - 5 new tests in `tests/rate-limit.test.ts` cover Retry-After parsing (integer, missing, garbage), non-429 errors staying as generic `Error`, and end-to-end propagation to the structured tool envelope.

- **Rate-limit scoping hints on fan-out tool descriptions.** Tools that LLMs commonly loop over (`autotask_search_ticket_notes`, `autotask_search_project_notes`, `autotask_search_company_notes`, `autotask_search_time_entries`, `autotask_search_ticket_attachments`) now include a "RATE LIMIT TIP" reminding the model to scope the parent record list before fanning out. The project_notes hint cites #69 by issue number so the model knows this is a known failure mode.

- **README "Rate limits" section** documents the per-integration thresholds, how to raise them in Autotask Admin (dedicated API user + Workflow Rules → API Tracking Identifier), and recommended scoping patterns.

- **Ticket history audit-trail tools** (`autotask_get_ticket_history`, `autotask_search_ticket_history`). Exposes the Autotask `/TicketHistory` entity (GET-only) so callers can answer "when did this ticket transition from status X to status Y", "who changed the priority", etc. `search` requires a `ticketId` (Autotask does not support unscoped history queries) and fails fast with a friendly error before any network round-trip if it's missing. Surfaced via the `tickets` category bundle.

### Fixed

- **`autotask_create_quote` put another company's address on the quote.** When the caller omitted the location IDs, `createQuote()` auto-populated all three from the company's first **CompanyLocation**. But `Quotes.billToLocationID` / `shipToLocationID` / `soldToLocationID` reference the **QuoteLocations** entity, which is a different table with an independent, overlapping id sequence. Feeding a CompanyLocation id into a quote is therefore either rejected (`Reference value on field: billToLocationID of type: QuoteLocation does not exist or is invalid`) or — the bad case — **silently accepted as a real QuoteLocation belonging to somebody else**. Measured on the live API 2026-07-08 and re-confirmed 2026-09-15: `CompanyLocations/2` is "PO Box 1134, Fairhope AL" (companyID 29687686) while `QuoteLocations/2` is "2411 Wolf Ridge Rd, Mobile AL". Four of four sampled ids collided. Nothing errors; the quote just carries the wrong client's address.
  - `createQuote()` now calls a new `createQuoteLocationForCompany()`, which snapshots the company's own address into a **fresh** QuoteLocation row. Caller-supplied IDs are still honoured, and a partially-supplied set fills only what is missing.
  - **Rows are never reused.** QuoteLocations are per-quote snapshots — Autotask's own UI creates three per quote, visible in an id sequence that steps by exactly 3 — so a 2011 quote keeps the address it was written with. An earlier cut of this fix reused a matching row; that leaked across clients when a company's address was only partially populated, and coupled quotes together so editing one address silently rewrote it on every quote pointing at that row.
  - **Provenance:** this fix existed since 2026-07 as a build-time `.patch` applied by a Dockerfile in a *different* repository, never as code here. When the deploy path changed on 2026-09-14 to build this repo directly, the patch stopped being applied and the leak returned — with nothing to notice, because a patch file has no tests. It is now a commit with 7 tests that assert on the outgoing requests (which entity is written, which ids reach the quote). Verified by mutation: against the pre-fix `createQuote`, 4 of the 7 fail.

- **The first ticket search after startup, and after every 30-minute lull, timed out.** `enhanceItems()` resolves company and resource IDs to names per row, and on a cold or expired cache that first lookup triggered a full-tenant walk — every company, paginated, plus every resource — **inline in the request that happened to touch it first**. On a large tenant that exceeds the MCP client's 60s timeout, so the caller got nothing back while the query underneath had completed in milliseconds. Cache expiry is 30 minutes, so it recurred after any half-hour lull and read as an intermittent timeout with no pattern. Isolated by elimination: the same filters through raw `/Tickets/query` returned instantly, a zero-result search returned instantly (the per-row enrichment loop never runs), and the identical search returned instantly once the cache was warm — complete with the enriched `company` field that was the point of the wait.
  - Callers now block on a warm for at most `MAPPING_CACHE_WARM_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 10s) and then fall through to the existing per-ID direct-get paths. The warm is not cancelled; it keeps loading and serves everyone after it.
  - An expired-but-populated cache is served **stale** and refreshed in the background, so an expiry is never paid for by whoever arrives first.
  - `getResourceName()`'s empty-cache short-circuit — which infers "this instance has no Resources endpoint" — now applies only once a load has actually completed. While the warm is in flight the cache is empty for an entirely different reason, and short-circuiting there dropped every resource name on exactly the early requests the bound exists to keep usable.
  - Fixed a latent bug found on the way: `initializeCache()` stamped `lastUpdated` for both halves unconditionally, after the refresh methods had already stamped their own. A load that failed or timed out therefore marked an **empty** cache as fresh, suppressing any retry for the full 30-minute window and silently disabling name resolution until expiry. The redundant stamps are gone.
  - 5 tests in `tests/mapping.test.ts` pin a hung warm not blocking the caller, the in-flight direct resource lookup, stale-while-revalidate, and the failed-warm retry. Verified by mutation: restoring the inline await fails 2.

- **`autotask_search_time_entries` still advertised `projectId`, and using it failed every time.** Removing `projectID` from the time-entry *write* path left it live on the *read* path: the search declared a `projectId` parameter, its description offered project as a filter dimension, and `searchTimeEntries()` mapped it to a filter on `projectID`. Writes and reads fail differently — Autotask ignores an unknown field on write, but **rejects a query on one** — so passing exactly what the schema advertised turned a working search into `HTTP 500: Unable to find projectID in the TimeEntry Entity`. Confirmed both through raw `/TimeEntries/query` and through the typed tool. The parameter and the filter are gone, the description now says project time is reached via its tasks, and the stale `projectID` declaration is removed from the `AutotaskTimeEntry` interface along with a dead project-scoped branch in `createTimeEntry()` that the handler had already made unreachable. Three tests in `tests/write-field-names.test.ts` cover the schema, the description, and — feeding `projectId` in deliberately, since a schema change does not stop `autotask_execute_tool` forwarding it — the outgoing filter body.

- **Four query filters used operators Autotask does not recognize, and were silently discarded.** Autotask validates field *names* on read but not filter *operators*: an unrecognized operator is dropped from the query rather than rejected, so the call succeeds and the answer is quietly wrong — the result set is either wider than asked for, or empty when nothing valid survives. Each was confirmed against the live API before being changed.
  - **`autotask_search_tickets` returned completed tickets by default.** With no explicit `status`, the search adds an "exclude Complete" condition — but it was built as `{op:'ne', field:'status', value:5}`, and the Autotask operator is `noteq`. `ne` was discarded, so the documented "omit status for all open tickets" behaviour in fact returned closed tickets too. Verified directly: `ne status 5` combined with `eq id <a Complete ticket>` returned that ticket, and `noteq` correctly returned nothing.
  - **`autotask_search_tickets({unassigned: true})` always returned zero rows.** Built as `{op:'eq', field:'assignedResourceID', value:null}`; Autotask matches no rows for an equality test against null. The operator for "this field is null" is `notExist`, which returns unassigned tickets correctly. This is the one search whose entire purpose is surfacing tickets nobody owns, and it had never worked.
  - **`autotask_search_time_entries({approvalStatus:'approved'})` always returned zero rows** — `isnotnull` is not an Autotask operator; the correct one is `exist`. Confirmed by running `isnotnull` against `dateWorked`, a field that is never null: zero rows, where `exist` returns rows.
  - **`autotask_search_time_entries({approvalStatus:'unapproved'})` always returned zero rows** — same `eq`-against-`null` mistake as `unassigned`, fixed to `notExist`.
  - The enabling condition was that `QueryFilter.op` was typed as bare `string` and passed verbatim into the request body, so nothing — not the compiler, not a test, not the API — ever objected. `op` is now a `QueryOperator` union over the operators the live API actually honours, and `query()` runs `assertValidFilters()`, which **throws** on an unrecognized operator and on any `eq`/`noteq` compared to `null`, naming `exist`/`notExist` instead. A loud failure is the point: a dropped filter is worse than a failed call because it is indistinguishable from a real answer. The spellings are verified individually rather than copied from the docs — `beginsWith` is honoured and `beginsw` is discarded, so the camelCase forms are the correct ones here.
  - 17 tests in `tests/query-filter-operators.test.ts` assert on the outgoing filter body, for the same reason the ticket-payload tests assert on the outgoing payload: the operator passes every type and schema right up until Autotask ignores it. Verified by mutation — restoring `ne` fails 3 of them.

- **Three write tools sent field names Autotask does not have.** A wrong name is worse than a dropped field: Autotask ignores unknown fields on write rather than rejecting them, so the call reports success and the value is silently discarded. Each name below was confirmed non-existent by querying the live API, which *does* validate field names on read.
  - **`autotask_create_time_entry` advertised `projectID`** — `GET /TimeEntries/query` filtering on it answers `Unable to find projectID in the TimeEntry Entity`. The tool's description offered to tie time to "a ticket, task, or project"; the third was never possible. Worse, `projectID` also drove the `isRegularTime` branch, so supplying it suppressed the billing-category requirement and produced an entry with **no parent and no category** — time logged against a project landed unparented while the call looked successful. The parameter is removed from the schema and dropped defensively in the handler, because `autotask_execute_tool` forwards arbitrary arguments and a schema change alone does not stop it arriving. Project work is logged against a TASK, which belongs to the project; the `taskID` description now says so.
  - **`autotask_create_expense_report` sent `description`** — `Unable to find description in the ExpenseReport Entity`. Removed from the payload and from the schema, since a parameter that cannot be stored should not be advertised.
  - **`autotask_create_project` sent `estimatedHours`** — `Unable to find estimatedHours in the Project Entity`; the field is `estimatedTime`. `autotask_update_project` has always used the correct name, so the two tools disagreed and create was the wrong one: an estimate given at creation never landed and had to be set by a follow-up update. The caller-facing parameter keeps its friendlier name and is mapped in the handler, the same way `startDate` → `startDateTime` already is.
  - Found by auditing all 34 create/update tools: each was driven through `callTool` with every declared field populated while every `AutotaskService` method was spied, and the emitted field names were then checked against the live schema. The other 31 are clean — the renames they perform (`amount` → `expenseCurrencyExpenseAmount`, `companyId` → `companyID`, `weekEndingDate` → `weekEnding`) were verified correct field by field.
  - **Follow-up:** removing `projectID` left prose behind — the `category` description still read "when no ticket/task/project is specified", pointing readers at a parameter that no longer existed. For an LLM-facing tool the description *is* the interface (it is what the model reads to decide what to pass), so a stale option there is a defect rather than a typo. Corrected, with a test that matches the shape the stale text had (`/project`, `projectID`) rather than the word: the tool and `taskID` descriptions mention projects deliberately, to say that project work is logged against a task.
  - **`autotask_create_time_entry` also leaked its two convenience inputs.** `resourceName` and `category` are resolved into `resourceID` and `internalBillingCodeID`; neither is a TimeEntry field. Both were deleted *inside* the branch that consumed them, so any call shape that skipped that branch forwarded the raw input: passing a `resourceName` alongside a `resourceID` skipped the resolve branch, and passing a `category` with a ticket or task skipped the Regular Time branch. Autotask ignored them silently. Both deletes are now unconditional — a guard narrower than the field is what caused this in the first place.
  - 12 new tests in `tests/write-field-names.test.ts`. They assert on the outgoing payload and feed the bad name in on purpose, because removing a parameter from a schema does not stop it arriving; a schema-only assertion would pass while the field still shipped.

- **`autotask_create_ticket` and `autotask_update_ticket` silently dropped `assignedResourceRoleID`, and `autotask_update_ticket` also dropped `dueDateTime`.** `buildTicketPayload()` copies an allow-list (`TICKET_WRITABLE_FIELDS`) out of the caller's arguments into the body sent to Autotask. Both fields were declared on the tool input schemas but missing from that list, so they were accepted from the caller without complaint and then discarded before the request was built.
  - `assignedResourceRoleID` failed loudly but misleadingly: Autotask rejects a body carrying `assignedResourceID` without its role with `HTTP 500: Data violation: When assigning a Resource, you must assign both a assignedResourceID and assignedResourceRoleID` — an error that names the field the caller *did* supply, pointing the caller at their own correct call rather than at the wrapper. The practical effect was that no ticket could be created or reassigned with an owner except through `autotask_raw_request`, so automated filing had to leave tickets unassigned in a queue.
  - `dueDateTime` failed silently: `autotask_update_ticket` returned success and the due date simply never changed.
  - Both fields added to `TICKET_WRITABLE_FIELDS`. The `// Keep this list in sync` comment is replaced with a note pointing at the test that now enforces it.
  - 8 new tests in `tests/ticket-payload.test.ts`. The important one is a drift guard that derives the declared property set from `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` for both ticket tools, pushes every field through `callTool`, and asserts none is missing from the payload handed to `createTicket()`/`updateTicket()` — so declaring a field without adding it to the allow-list fails at the point the field is added. This is the third instance of this bug class (`issueType`/`subIssueType` were fixed the same way for #109 without generalizing the guard), which is why the assertions are on the outgoing payload rather than the schema: a schema-level test passes for the entire life of this bug, because the field *is* declared — it just never ships.
  - Two tests pin the surrounding behaviour so widening the allow-list doesn't turn into forwarding the caller's whole argument bag: unknown arguments are still dropped, and omitted fields are not sent as `undefined` keys.

- **Contact updates were completely broken on Autotask Zone 18 / DE1** ([#133](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/133)). `autotask_update_contact` (and every other `update()` caller) issues a collection-level `PATCH /{Entity}` with the id in the body — the only update route Autotask documents. On the European DE1 zone (`webservices18.autotask.net`) that route is not registered in IIS and returns an HTML **404**, while item-level `PATCH /{Entity}/{id}` is rejected with 405, so updates failed on every attempt with no workaround.
  - `AutotaskHttpClient.update()` now falls back to `PUT /{Entity}/{id}` (universally supported across zones) **only** when the collection PATCH returns a 404. The fallback is gated strictly on the numeric status, so genuine 400/422 validation errors still surface to the caller unchanged.
  - `AutotaskHttpClient.request()` now attaches the numeric `status` to thrown HTTP errors so callers branch on it reliably instead of substring-matching the message (the message embeds the response body, which can coincidentally contain a status-like number).
  - **`autotask_update_contact` now exposes `userDefinedFields`** (`[{name, value}]`), matching `autotask_update_ticket`. Contacts are `hasUserDefinedFields: true`, but the schema previously omitted the field, so custom-field updates were impossible. The handler already forwarded all args, so only the schema needed the addition.
  - **`autotask_raw_request` now allows `PUT`** — added to both the runtime method allowlist *and* the advertised `method` enum in the tool schema (they were inconsistent before this would have surfaced), so the item-level update route is reachable via the raw escape hatch and the LLM is actually told it exists.
  - 6 new tests in `tests/contact-update-zone18.test.ts`: PATCH→PUT fallback on 404, no-fallback on 400 (incl. a 400 whose body contains "404"), no spurious PUT when PATCH succeeds, the `userDefinedFields` schema shape, the `rawRequest` PUT enum/runtime consistency, and PUT acceptance through `rawRequest`.
  - Out of scope (no DE1 evidence, untested): `AutotaskHttpClient.childUpdate()` issues the same collection-style PATCH on nested `/{parent}/{id}/{child}` routes and would also 404 on DE1 if those routes are likewise unregistered. The top-level `update()` covers all 10 entity update paths in the service; nested child updates are a separate, unverified route shape and were intentionally left alone.

- **`listAllCompanies` and other `query()` callers now clamp the per-page `MaxRecords` body param to the Autotask API limit (500).** `AutotaskHttpClient.query()` previously passed the caller's `opts.maxRecords` value directly as the per-page `MaxRecords` field in the request body. `MappingService.refreshCompanyCache()` calls `listAllCompanies(20_000)`, which produced `MaxRecords: 20000` in the request — Autotask responds with HTTP 500 "maxCountOfRecordsToReturn must be between 1 and 500". The cache pre-warm worked fine on the legacy static-singleton MappingService because it ran exactly once per process and the failure was silently absorbed into an empty cache; once the cache was made per-request the same call ran on every request and surfaced the API error on every call.
  - Introduced an exported `AUTOTASK_MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 500` constant in `src/services/autotask-http.ts`.
  - `query()` now treats `opts.maxRecords` as the **total cap** (how many rows to collect across the whole pagination walk) and derives the **per-page size** as `min(totalCap, AUTOTASK_MAX_PAGE_SIZE)`. The cursor walk continues to follow `pageDetails.nextPageUrl` until the total cap is reached.
  - `childQuery()` clamps its per-page `MaxRecords` to `AUTOTASK_MAX_PAGE_SIZE` for the same reason. `childQuery` does not walk `nextPageUrl`, so only the clamp matters there.
  - 2 new regression tests in `tests/autotask-service.test.ts` under `Per-page MaxRecords clamping`:
    - `listAllCompanies` with the default 20_000 cap captures the actual `MaxRecords` value sent and asserts it is `<= 500`, while still returning all 700 records from a multi-page tenant.
    - `query()` honors a small caller cap (25) by sending exactly `MaxRecords: 25` — small queries don't pay the full 500-row page cost.

- **Per-instance `MappingService` for proper tenant isolation in gateway mode.** Aligns the `MappingService` lifecycle with the per-request `AutotaskToolHandler` introduced in the worker refactor so each request gets its own mapping cache scoped to the request's credentials.
  - Removed `static initPromise` and `private constructor`. Replaced the static `getInstance()` factory with a per-call `MappingService.create(autotaskService, logger, options)` that constructs a fresh instance bound to the supplied `AutotaskService` and awaits its cache initialization. Concurrent inits on the same instance still coalesce via a new per-instance `initPromise`.
  - `AutotaskToolHandler.getMappingService()` now calls `MappingService.create(...)`. Because `AutotaskToolHandler` is already constructed per-request in gateway mode (via `McpServer.buildPerRequestHandlers`, added in the worker refactor), each request now ends up with its own isolated `MappingService`.
  - Gateway-mode `/mcp` now rejects requests missing any of `X-API-Key` / `X-API-Secret` / `X-Integration-Code` with HTTP 401 (JSON-RPC error `-32001`) instead of falling through to the env-configured `this.toolHandler`.
  - 4 new regression tests in `tests/mapping.test.ts` under `tenant isolation`: independent instances per tenant, no cross-pollution under concurrent init, isolated cache-clear semantics, and a 10-tenant high-fan-out parallel-init each-sees-only-own-data assertion. The `should return the same instance on subsequent calls` test was inverted to `should return a DISTINCT instance on each call` to guard against re-introducing the previous singleton shape.

- **deploy:** clarified that the one-click DigitalOcean deploy needs **no**
  GitHub Packages token. Unlike the other WYRE MCP servers, `autotask-mcp` has
  no private `@wyre-technology/*` GitHub Packages dependency — its only WYRE
  dependency is the `autotask-node` SDK, declared as a git dependency on the
  **public** `wyre-technology/autotask-node` repo, which `npm install` resolves
  anonymously. Added a README note so operators don't add an unnecessary build
  variable. (No `.npmrc` is created, because the package is not on the GitHub
  Packages npm registry.)

- **`autotask_create_ticket_note` exposed internal notes to clients via wrong picklist labels** ([#126](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/126)). The tool's `noteType` and `publish` descriptions hardcoded labels like `1=Internal Only, 2=All Autotask Users, 3=Everyone` — but Autotask picklist IDs are tenant-configurable, and in many tenants `1` actually maps to *All Autotask Users* (the opposite of "Internal Only"). The handler also silently defaulted both fields to `1` when the LLM omitted them. Notes intended to be internal were being published externally.
  - Fix: replaced the hardcoded labels with descriptions that direct the caller to `autotask_get_field_info` (entity `TicketNotes`, fields `noteType` and `publish`) — same pattern used by every other picklist field in the codebase. Made both fields `required` in the schema and added explicit handler-side guards so omission fails fast with an actionable error message instead of silently defaulting.
  - 4 new tests in `tests/create-ticket-note-picklist.test.ts` pin the schema's `required` array, the absence of the wrong baked-in labels, and the discovery-hint error messages.
  - Out of scope (same bug pattern, separate fix): `autotask_create_project_note` has identical hardcoded labels at `tool.definitions.ts:1309-1316`. Flagged but not changed here.

- **Four `search*` tools advertised filter params they silently dropped** ([#104](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/104), [#105](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/105)). `searchContracts`, `searchConfigurationItems`, `searchInvoices`, and `searchTasks` all published `inputSchema` properties like `companyID`, `searchTerm`, `status`, `assignedResourceID` — every property described as "Filter by …" — but the service methods read only `options.filter` and `options.pageSize`. The advertised properties were accepted, logged at debug level, then discarded. Callers got the same MATCH_ALL page-1 slice regardless of what they passed.
  - Effect: typed search tools were useless for any non-trivial query. Workaround was `autotask_raw_request`, which defeats the purpose of having schema-typed tools and isn't discoverable by MCP clients reading the catalog.
  - Fix: each method now mirrors the `searchProjects` pattern that was already in place — translates schema-shaped args into `QueryFilter[]` entries, with the `options.filter` escape hatch preserved for advanced callers. Field-name mappings per Autotask REST entity:
    - **Contracts**: `companyID`, `status`, `contractName` (for `searchTerm`)
    - **ConfigurationItems**: `companyID`, `isActive`, `productID`, `referenceTitle` (for `searchTerm`)
    - **Invoices**: `companyID`, `invoiceNumber`, `isVoided`
    - **Tasks**: `projectID`, `status`, `assignedResourceID`, `title` (for `searchTerm`)
  - `searchTasks` also dropped its advertised `page` argument — same bug class as the #101 fix to `searchCompanies`. Applied the same fetch-and-slice pattern over `http.query`'s cursor pagination.
  - 6 new tests in `tests/autotask-service.test.ts` mock `fetch` directly and assert the request body's `filter` array reflects each translated property. The "no filter args sends MATCH_ALL" test pins the no-regression case.
  - Defensive grep confirmed the contained scope: no other `search*` method on this service has the broken `Array.isArray(options.filter)`-only pattern. `getTimeEntries` has the same shape but isn't exposed via a search tool (`searchTimeEntries` is the real handler at line 2078).

- **`serverInfo.version` reported hardcoded `"1.0.0"` regardless of the running release** ([#94](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/94)). Both `src/utils/config.ts` and `src/mcp/server.ts` fell back to a literal `'1.0.0'` string instead of the actual build version. Effect: every release through `v2.x.x` reported `1.0.0` in the MCP `initialize` handshake. Clients that surface `serverInfo.version` (Claude Code's `claude mcp list`, etc.) showed `1.0.0` regardless of which image was actually running, making operator triage / bug-report attribution unreliable.
  - Fix:
    - Both fallback chains now read from the bundled `package.json` (TypeScript's `resolveJsonModule` was already enabled). Priority order: `MCP_SERVER_VERSION env > packageJson.version > 'unknown'`.
    - The Dockerfile patches `package.json`'s `version` field at build time using the existing `VERSION` build arg before `npm run build`. This is necessary because branch protection silently drops `@semantic-release/git`'s push-back on this repo — `package.json` on `main` stays stale, so the release pipeline has to inject the real version at image-build time. Local builds (where `VERSION="unknown"`) skip the patch so the checked-in `package.json` version is preserved.
    - Production stage now copies `package.json` from the builder (with the patch) rather than the build context.
  - `/health` endpoint now includes a `version` field so operators can `curl` for the running build without going through the MCP handshake.

- **`searchCompanies` silently dropped the `page` parameter** ([#101](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/101)). The method's `AutotaskQueryOptions` interface accepts `page`, but the implementation only forwarded `pageSize` to `http.query` — every call returned the first page regardless. `MappingService.refreshCompanyCache` looped 1..100 expecting offset pagination, hammered the same page 100×, and ended up with at most 200 companies cached after burning ~100 pagination API calls.
  - Effect: every tool call hung ~80s on first invocation (and every 30 min on TTL expiry) while the broken loop ran. On tenants with more than 200 companies, IDs past the first page fell through to single-record `getCompany(id)` direct-get. Symptom from the user side: `autotask_test_connection`, `autotask_search_companies` etc. hung on first call; only meta-tools worked.
  - Fix:
    - `searchCompanies` now honors `page` by fetching up to `page * pageSize` records via `http.query` (which already walks Autotask's cursor pagination internally) and slicing the target window. Wasteful at high page numbers, but Autotask's REST API is cursor-based — there is no native offset, and this matches what callers expect.
    - New `listAllCompanies(maxRecords = 20_000)` method for bulk pre-warm: single `http.query` call with no filtering and a large `maxRecords`, letting `http.query`'s built-in `nextPageUrl` walker do its job. Logs a warning if the cap is hit.
    - `MappingService.refreshCompanyCache` now calls `listAllCompanies()` once instead of looping. Atomic-swap-on-success semantics from the prior fix are preserved.
  - Test layer up: the previous pagination tests in `tests/mapping.test.ts` mocked `searchCompanies` directly and asserted call signatures — they passed because the mock observed the `page` argument production was dropping. New tests in `tests/autotask-service.test.ts` mock `fetch` and prove pagination behavior end-to-end through `http.query`.

- **`LAZY_LOADING` env var was dead code in `MappingService`** ([#101](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp/issues/101)). The flag is parsed in `src/utils/config.ts` and passed to `AutotaskToolHandler`, where it filters the `listTools()` output to hide non-meta tools. It never reached `MappingService.initializeCache`, so the eager company/resource cache pre-warm ran on every server start regardless. There was no documented way to opt out of the 80-second startup cost.
  - Fix: `MappingService.getInstance` now accepts `{ lazyLoading }` and forwards it to the constructor. When set, `initializeCache()` returns immediately and `refreshCacheIfNeeded()` is a no-op. `getCompanyName()` and `getResourceName()` fall through to their existing per-record direct-get paths. Trade-off: one extra API call per unique ID per response, no startup hang.
  - Wired through from `tool.handler.ts` so the env var flows: `LAZY_LOADING=true` → `AutotaskMcpServer` → `AutotaskToolHandler` → `MappingService`.

- **`autotask_get_ticket_attachment` silently dropped the `includeData` flag** — the tool advertised an `includeData` parameter and the service method accepted it, but the implementation always called the child endpoint `GET /Tickets/{id}/Attachments/{aid}` which **never** populates the `data` field. Callers asking for the binary got back metadata with `data: undefined` 100% of the time, which surfaced in the community as "issues pulling attachments consistently."
  - Root cause: two distinct Autotask endpoints. The child endpoint (`/Tickets/{id}/Attachments/{aid}`) returns metadata only; the top-level entity endpoint (`/TicketAttachments/{id}`) returns metadata **plus** the base64 binary in `data`. The service was hardcoded to the former regardless of `includeData`.
  - Fix: `getTicketAttachment` now routes to `/TicketAttachments/{id}` when `includeData=true`, with three safety nets: (1) the returned attachment's `ticketID` is verified to match the requested `ticketId` (returns null on mismatch — defense against cross-ticket reads if a caller passes a wrong parent), (2) oversized binaries are stripped before return with a `dataOmittedReason` field explaining why (default cap 1,000,000 base64 bytes ≈ 750 KB raw, configurable per call via `maxInlineBase64Bytes`), and (3) the metadata-only path still uses the cheaper child endpoint when `includeData` is false/omitted.
  - Why the size cap: Autotask attachments can be up to 3 MB raw (~4 MB base64). MCP client tool-result limits are typically ~1 MB. Without the cap, large attachments would arrive truncated/garbled at the client even with the correct endpoint, reproducing the "didn't work" outcome through a different failure mode.
  - Test coverage: 5 new endpoint-routing tests in `tests/autotask-service.test.ts` covering metadata-only path, data-returning path, size guard, cross-ticket isolation, and explicit size override.

- **`MappingService` company cache was silently truncated to 25 entries** — `refreshCompanyCache()` called `searchCompanies({})` assuming "no pageSize = fetch all pages", but the underlying `searchCompanies` defaults to `pageSize: 25, page: 1` and returns only the first page. The cache was then logged as `"COMPLETE dataset"`, which was incorrect.
  - Effect: for any company whose ID wasn't on the first page (~everything past ID ~198 in a typical tenant), `getCompanyName()` fell through to a single-record `getCompany(id)` direct-lookup. When the Autotask REST direct-get returned a stale or renamed name (observed for at least one merged/renamed company in the wild), that wrong name was written into the cache and served to every downstream consumer — `autotask_search_tickets`, `autotask_search_projects`, notes, time entries, etc. — for a 30-minute cache window. Surface: the `company` field on enriched responses displayed the wrong tenant name, which looks like cross-tenant data leakage even though the underlying IDs and ownership were correct.
  - Fix: `refreshCompanyCache()` now actually paginates — loops `searchCompanies({page, pageSize: 200})` until a short page is returned, building a fresh `Map` and atomic-swapping it into the cache only after full success (partial failures keep the prior cache rather than replacing it with a shorter one). Safety cap of 100 pages (20k companies) logs a warning rather than running forever.
  - Hardening: `getCompanyName()` still falls back to single-record `getCompany(id)` for companies added between refresh windows, but the fallback result is no longer written to the cache. This prevents a stale/wrong direct-get from poisoning the cache and being served to every subsequent caller.
  - Added `tests/mapping.test.ts` coverage: multi-page pagination, early-stop on short page, and fallback-does-not-poison-cache.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **License**: Changed from MIT to Apache 2.0

### Added
- **CLA**: Added Contributor License Agreement for contributors

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-21

### Breaking Changes
- **Tool Namespacing**: All 35 MCP tools now use `autotask_` prefix to prevent naming collisions when multiple MCP servers are connected
  - `search_companies` → `autotask_search_companies`
  - `create_ticket` → `autotask_create_ticket`
  - `test_connection` → `autotask_test_connection`
  - All other tools follow the same pattern: `autotask_<original_name>`
- **Migration Required**: Update all tool calls in your MCP client configuration to use the new namespaced names

### Changed
- All tool definitions in `tool.handler.ts` updated with `autotask_` prefix
- Documentation updated to reflect new tool names

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Issue #9: Inaccurate Endpoints, Excessive Calls**: Upgraded to `autotask-node` v2.0.2 which fixes the critical `maxRecords` casing bug. The Autotask REST API is case-sensitive and was silently ignoring `MaxRecords` (uppercase M), causing all records to be returned instead of paginated results.
- **Issue #8: Claude Desktop and Docker unable to return results**: Added `searchTerm` → filter transformation for Companies, Contacts, and Resources
  - Company searches now filter on `companyName` field instead of fetching all companies
  - Contact searches now filter across `firstName`, `lastName`, and `emailAddress` fields
  - Resource searches now filter across `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName` fields
  - When searching with `searchTerm`, limits pagination to 100 results for efficiency
- **Issue #3: Autotask MCP out of sync with REST schema**: Fixed by upgrading to `autotask-node` v2.0.2 which corrects:
  - `MaxRecords` → `maxRecords` (lowercase m) across all 214 entity files
  - Proper POST `/query` endpoint usage for all list operations

### Changed
- **Dependency Upgrade**: Updated `autotask-node` to v2.0.2 with critical pagination fix
- **Search Efficiency**: When `searchTerm` is provided, searches return filtered results directly from API instead of paginating through all records

### Fixed (Previous)
- **🚨 CRITICAL DATA ACCURACY FIX**: Implemented pagination-by-default to eliminate massive ticket undercounts
  - **Root Cause**: Default page size was limited to 25-50 tickets, causing severe data accuracy issues
  - **Solution**: All search tools now paginate through ALL results by default for complete datasets
  - **Impact**: Fixes undercounting from 26 tickets to actual counts (e.g., 97+ tickets)
  - **User Control**: Only specify `pageSize` parameter when you actually want to limit results
- **CRITICAL: Massive Ticket Undercount**: Fixed automatic company filter that was severely limiting ticket search results (was showing only ~10 tickets instead of 97+)
- **Critical Unassigned Ticket Search Issue**: Fixed inability to search for unassigned tickets that was causing discrepancies between UI and API results
- **Parameter Mapping Issue**: Fixed `companyID` to `companyId` parameter mapping in `search_tickets` tool handler
- Enhanced ticket filtering logic to properly handle all filter parameters including assignment status

### Changed
- **Default Behavior**: `search_tickets` and all search tools now return complete datasets via automatic pagination
- **Performance**: Increased page size to 500 tickets per API request for efficiency while paginating
- **Safety**: Added pagination safety limit of 100 pages (50,000 tickets) to prevent infinite loops
- **Tool Descriptions**: Updated all search tool descriptions to clarify pagination-by-default behavior
- **Status Filtering**: Improved open ticket definition (status < 5) for accurate filtering

### Added
- **Data Accuracy Guarantee**: All search operations now provide complete, paginated results by default
- **Enhanced ID-to-Name Mapping**: Comprehensive mapping service with intelligent caching
  - New tools: `get_company_name`, `get_resource_name`, `get_mapping_cache_stats`, `clear_mapping_cache`, `preload_mapping_cache`
  - Automatic enhancement of search results with `_enhanced` field containing resolved names
  - 30-minute cache expiry with graceful fallback for missing data
- **Pagination Testing**: Added test scripts to verify complete data retrieval (`npm run test:pagination`)
- **Unassigned Ticket Support**: Added `unassigned` boolean parameter to `search_tickets` tool to search for tickets without assigned resources
- **Enhanced Tool Handler**: `EnhancedAutotaskToolHandler` with automatic ID-to-name resolution

### Fixed (Additional)
- **CRITICAL: Incomplete Company/Resource Mapping**: Fixed mapping cache that was limited to 500 records, causing "Customer 624" style names instead of proper company names
- **All Search Methods Now Complete**: Applied pagination-by-default to `searchCompanies`, `searchContacts`, and `searchResources` to ensure mapping cache includes ALL entities
- **Graceful Mapping Fallback**: Enhanced mapping service to not throw errors on cache failures, allowing direct API lookups as fallback

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Resolved "result exceeds maximum length" errors in ticket searches by implementing aggressive data optimization
- Limited ticket search results to maximum 3 tickets per query to stay under 1MB MCP response limit
- Reduced ticket data from 76 fields (~2KB per ticket) to 18 essential fields (~685 characters per ticket)
- Added service-level result limiting as safety measure since Autotask API may ignore pageSize parameter
- Improved null handling in ticket data optimization to prevent runtime errors

### Changed
- Updated `search_tickets` tool description to clarify field limitations and recommend `get_ticket_details` for full data
- Reduced maximum pageSize for ticket searches from 100 to 3 due to API response size constraints
- Enhanced ticket data truncation with clear indicators to use `get_ticket_details` for full content

### Added
